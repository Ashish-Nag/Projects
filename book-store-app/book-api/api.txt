WE will create REST api in the following steps : 

    1> create folder structure using best practics
    2> create Routing
    3> create model
    4> create api controller
    5> create Repo


What is an api : 

    REST api : Representation state transfer protocol
    SOAP : simple object access protocol

    REST is preferred over soap because rest is lightweight while soap is heavier and therefore slow.

    SOAP has multiple redundant codes which makes it heavier and slow.

Repository is responsible for establishing connections with databases.
